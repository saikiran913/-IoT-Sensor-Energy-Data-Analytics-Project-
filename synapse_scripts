#~ Create a Table in the synapse platform after creating table we will load the data from 
Databricks into the Synapse Analytics Sql DataBase:-

CREATE TABLE energy_sensor_data (
    Year_Factor INT, State_Factor NVARCHAR(50), building_class NVARCHAR(50),
    facility_type NVARCHAR(100), floor_area FLOAT, year_built FLOAT,
    energy_star_rating FLOAT, ELEVATION FLOAT,
    january_min_temp INT, january_avg_temp FLOAT, ..., site_eui FLOAT, id INT
);

~ After creating the Table, We need to do Data Validation in Synapse ~

-- Row count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM energy_sensor_data;

-- Sample records
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM energy_sensor_data;

-- Check for anomalies
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM energy_sensor_data WHERE anomaly = 1;

-- Group by facility type
SELECT facility_type, COUNT(*) FROM energy_sensor_data GROUP BY facility_type;
